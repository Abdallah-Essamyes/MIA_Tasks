This is a description of the tasks in each branch

**Task 1:**
	This task consisted of training on c++ language by praciticing coding some simple programs in it
	
**Task 2:**
	This task consisted of developing simple circuits on circuit simulation software to implement
	the fundmentals of electric circuit
	
**Task 3: <br>
	This task was about implementing the basics of microcontrollers and how they communicate with
	different sensors to do different tasks
	
**Task 4:
	This task was about understanding machine learning and implementing them to solve different types
	of problems and creating a chess game to implement the python game gui basics

**Task 5:
	This task was to understand the different communication protocols and the noise and error sources
	that arise in signal processing and implementing different microcontroller communication protocols.
	
**Task 6:
